# Pretty Shelf Kotlin

A book cataloguing system

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a simple book cataloguing application in Kotlin.

So far, it queries the [OpenLibrary API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api) to allow the user to search for a book using its ISBN.

It was created to help me compare making apps in Swift, Dart and Kotlin.

- The [Dart/Flutter](https://github.com/SedaKunda/PrettyShelf) version
